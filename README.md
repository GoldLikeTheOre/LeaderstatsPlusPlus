# Leaderstats++

Leaderstats++ (also referred to as LeaderstatsPlusPlus) is a unique take on the leaderstats system.

## Description

This system consists of multiple functions and ease of use so creating leaderstats can be easy for everyone (as if it wasn't easy already)

## Getting Started

To get started, download the RBXM file and insert it into your game. Then, require the module in another script! It's that easy!

## WARNING

The code sucks.

## License

License? What license?
